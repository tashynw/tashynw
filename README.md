- 👋 Hi, I’m Tashyn Wallace, a first year student studying Computer Science at the University of the West Indies. 
- 👀 I’m interested in anything software related. I currently know C, Python, HTML and CSS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Kotlin, followed by Javascript, C++ and C# in the near future.
- 💞️ Check out my python projects in my repositories that I made within the first six months of university due to curiosity. 
      I will update the projects as I learn different programming principles. You can track my progress by analyzing the code. 
- 📫 You can contact me at wallacetashyn@gmail.com

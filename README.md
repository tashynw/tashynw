- 👋 Hi, I’m Tashyn Wallace, a first year student studying Computer Science at the University of the West Indies. 
- 👀 I’m interested in anything software related. I currently know basic React, C#, Java and many other languages/frameworks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced C# .NET(ASP.NET, Winforms, Xamarin etc) and advanced React JS development (redux etc).
- 💞️ Check out my projects in my repositories that I made within my first year of university. 
      I will update the projects as I learn different programming principles. You can track my progress by analyzing the code.
